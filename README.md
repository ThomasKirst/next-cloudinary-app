# NextJS Cloudinary Upload

A simple client-based cloudinary integration on NextJS.

It takes an image to upload, tries to find a face on the picture, and crops the image.

In addition, the tags, which are selected by the user, will be stored as metadata attached to the image in cloudinary.

ThatÂ´s all ðŸ˜‰
